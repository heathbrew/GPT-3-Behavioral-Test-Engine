# GPT-3-Behavioral-Test-Engine
 A GPT-3 search engine that generates response to user's query about behavioral tests for a job role. Uses OpenAI API and Streamlit for input and response display. Accepts job role, tests, and sum of percentages as input and generates response by sorting tests and assigning percentages.

To run this code, you will need to have an OpenAI API key and set it as an environment variable. The code uses the Streamlit library to create a user interface for input and display of the response.

The code takes the job role, behavioral tests, and sum of percentages as input and generates a response based on the OpenAI API. The response is displayed in the app. The response is generated by sorting the behavioral tests and assigning them percentages that sum up to the specified total.
